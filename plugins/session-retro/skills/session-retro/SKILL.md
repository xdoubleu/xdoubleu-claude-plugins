description: Analyze the current session's own tool calls, retries, and CI runs for concrete inefficiencies (redundant reads, avoidable back-and-forth, a missing or under-triggered skill/MCP tool, a doc gap, an inherited workaround rule that's gone stale, an ad-hoc command that should be a Makefile/npm-script/build-tool target) and, only when something real turns up, verify the actual root cause and ship the smallest fix as its own tracking issue and independent PR. Run as the last step of any task-shipping flow; also use standalone when the user asks to "reflect on this session", "run a retro", or "how could this have been done more efficiently".

# Session Retro

Reflects on the work just completed in this session and looks for concrete
ways future sessions could do the same kind of work with fewer tool calls,
less token usage, and less CI back-and-forth — then ships any real finding
as its own tracking issue and independent PR. The analysis itself is
mandatory every time a work item finishes; only findings backed by
something that actually happened this session turn into an issue/PR.

## What counts as a "concrete" finding

Only flag something you can point to in *this session's own history* — a
specific tool call, a specific retry, a specific CI failure. Never propose a
change on pure speculation ("this would probably help") or because a
hypothetical future task might benefit. If nothing concrete happened, say so
and stop — an empty retro is a normal, healthy outcome, not a failure to
find something.

## What to look for

Review the session's own tool-call and commit history (not the wider
codebase, not other sessions) for these patterns:

1. **Redundant or serial tool calls that should've been fewer/parallel**
   - The same file read more than once, or read in full when a targeted
     search would have found the one relevant section.
   - Several independent tool calls issued one at a time across separate
     turns when the project's own conventions already say to batch
     independent calls in parallel.
   - A multi-step CLI sequence (git/gh/docker/etc.) that recurs across
     sessions and isn't yet a Make/npm/build-tool target or script.

2. **Token-heavy reads**
   - A large file read start-to-finish to find one function/constant — a
     search pass first would have scoped it.
   - A generated-code directory or mocks directory read directly instead of
     the source-of-truth interface/schema the project's own docs say to
     prefer.
   - Verbose command output (e.g. an unfiltered log, a CI-status check
     polled before it had settled) that could've been piped/filtered.

3. **Avoidable CI back-and-forth**
   - Did the PR need more than one push to go green? For each red run, what
     actually failed, and would a local lint/test/build command have caught
     it before pushing?

4. **Missing or under-triggered skills / MCP tools**
   - A procedure was reconstructed from project docs or memory that matches
     an existing skill's territory, but the skill wasn't invoked — is its
     `description` too narrow or ambiguous to have matched this phrasing?
   - A production-data or investigation question needed manual multi-step
     digging that a new or corrected MCP tool would answer in one call.
   - A multi-step procedure with no skill at all that recurred this session
     (run more than once) or that the project's own docs document as a
     repeated gotcha.

5. **Doc gaps**
   - A convention, gotcha, or ordering rule had to be rediscovered this
     session (by trial and error, or by asking) that isn't written down
     anywhere it would've been found first.

6. **Inherited workaround rules worth re-verifying**
   - A CLAUDE.md/README/skill/code comment states an "always do X in this
     order" / "always avoid Y" rule that exists to work around some other
     tool's behavior. Before treating that rule as settled, check whether
     it's still *true* — has the underlying tool/config since changed to
     make the workaround unnecessary? A rule that was correct when written
     but never re-verified against the current config is exactly the kind
     of stale claim that misleads the next reader — test it (run the actual
     commands, read the actual config) rather than propagating it forward
     unverified.

7. **Ad-hoc commands that belong in the Makefile/npm scripts/build tool, not prose**
   - If this repo has a standing rule to always use commands already
     defined in its build tooling instead of improvising an equivalent with
     raw invocations, follow it — and never let a docs file describe *how* a
     check works in prose instead of just naming the command that runs it.
     If a needed command doesn't exist yet, add it to the build tooling; if
     an existing target doesn't do quite what's needed (wrong flags, missing
     a step, doesn't match what CI actually runs), fix the target itself.
   - Two symptoms to watch for: (a) this session ran an ad-hoc shell
     one-liner to verify or check something instead of using (or adding) a
     build-tool target; (b) a docs file re-explains a command's internal
     mechanics (flags, exclusion config, tool behavior) rather than naming
     the command and its purpose — prose like that is duplicated knowledge
     waiting to drift, since nothing keeps two docs files' explanations of
     the same mechanics in sync.
   - The other direction of the same failure mode: a documented command can
     stop existing (or stop working) after a refactor, and nothing catches
     it if nobody actually runs it. Before pointing to a build-tool command
     in a fix — or trusting one already documented — actually run it once
     rather than assuming a command mentioned in the docs still works.

8. **Fetching/preprocessing that should've been delegated to a subagent**
   - This session made a large or noisy tool-call sequence directly in the
     main context — a broad grep sweep, an unfiltered log pull, several
     chained MCP calls, a multi-file exploration — whose raw output was
     mostly discarded after extracting one fact. A subagent could have done
     the same digging and returned only the distilled result, keeping the
     raw output out of the main context entirely.
   - A file or MCP response was read in full into the main context when only
     a summary or a specific field was actually used downstream.

## Steps

1. **Scan this session's own history** — the tool calls actually made, the
   commits on this branch, and (if a PR was opened) its CI check history —
   against the eight categories above.
2. **Decide if anything is concrete enough to act on.** A single minor
   inefficiency with no clear fix isn't worth an issue. A repeated pattern,
   a CI failure with an obvious local check that would've caught it, or a
   skill/tool gap that clearly would have shortened this exact session —
   those are.
3. **If nothing concrete: report a one-line "no retro findings this
   session" and stop.** Do not open an issue or PR for a null result.
4. **If something concrete: verify the actual root cause before picking a
   fix.** Don't accept an existing rule's stated reason at face value, and
   don't encode a workaround as a new procedure/skill/doc rule without first
   checking — empirically, if you can (run the command, read the config) —
   whether a tool/config change could eliminate the problem outright. A fix
   that removes the need for a rule always beats a fix that documents the
   rule more thoroughly or automates following it. Once the root cause is
   confirmed, pick the smallest fix that addresses it — **prefer adding or
   fixing a build-tool target over writing new docs prose whenever the
   finding is about how to run or verify something**; a docs edit should
   name the command and say why it matters, not reproduce its mechanics.
   Other fix types: a new/edited skill, a lint rule, an MCP tool
   addition/fix. Don't bundle unrelated findings into one fix if they'd
   naturally ship as separate PRs.
5. **Ship each fix exactly like any other task, in its own lane — never
   stacked on the work item's own branch/PR**:
   - Use this repo's own fresh-worktree skill (e.g. `task-worktree`) for a
     completely fresh worktree off the default branch and a new tracking
     issue (describing the inefficiency observed and the fix) — not a
     comment tacked onto the original issue.
   - Make the change.
   - Use this repo's own shipping skill (e.g. `ship-pr`) to ship it —
     lint/test/build as applicable, PR opened and referencing the new
     issue, CI watched to green. The same auto-merge rule applies normally
     (a skill/docs/tooling edit usually means no auto-merge, wait for
     review).
6. **Report back**: what was scanned, what (if anything) was found, and the
   issue/PR link(s) for anything shipped.

## Notes

- Run this every time a work item finishes, not just when something feels
  obviously wasteful. Most runs should find nothing; that's expected, not a
  sign to lower the bar for what counts as "concrete."
- Never fold a retro fix into the work item's own PR, even a tiny one-line
  docs tweak — a separate issue/PR keeps the (possibly already-merged or
  auto-merging) original PR reviewable on its own terms and gives the retro
  fix its own CI run.
- If a retro finding is about the fresh-worktree/shipping skills or this
  skill itself, edit those skill files directly — the same rules (fresh
  worktree, own issue, own PR) apply to editing a skill as to any other
  tooling change.
