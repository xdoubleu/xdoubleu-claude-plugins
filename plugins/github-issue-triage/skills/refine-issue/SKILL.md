name: refine-issue
description: Create or refine a single GitHub issue — summary, type/scope labels, priority, and project-board status — and keep a "## Plan" section in its body in sync — and confirm the scope with the user before any code is written. Use when starting work that has no tracking issue yet, when a plan-mode plan needs to be recorded on an issue, or when development begins and an issue's status should move to "in progress".

# Refine Issue

Single-issue version of the refinement `issue-triage` does in bulk: give one
issue a summary, the right labels, a priority, and a status on the project
board (if one is configured). Also owns keeping a `## Plan` section on the
issue in sync with plan mode, and moving status to "in progress" once
development actually starts.

`issue-triage` reuses the config/labels/priority-rule below rather than
redefining them — keep the two in sync if any of this changes.

## Config

This skill is config-driven so it works across repos without editing the
skill itself. Look for `.claude/github-triage.config.json` at the target
repo's root:

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/name",
  "project": { "owner": "owner-login", "number": 8 },
  "labels": {
    "types": ["bug", "enhancement", "feature", "chore", "documentation"],
    "scopes": ["area-a", "area-b"],
    "fallbackScope": "platform"
  },
  "priorityRule": "P0 = fixes/restores something already working today that's now broken. P1 = improves existing, working functionality. P2 = brand-new features that don't exist yet. A shiny new feature never outranks a broken thing.",
  "markerLabel": "triaged"
}
```

- `project` is optional — omit it entirely if this repo has no project
  board, and skip every project-board step below.
- `labels.types`/`labels.scopes` should list labels that **already exist**
  in the repo — don't invent new ones; run `gh label list --repo <repo>` if
  unsure what's actually there.
- `priorityRule` is free text describing this repo's own P0/P1/P2 (or
  equivalent) ordering — apply it verbatim over any other instinct. When an
  issue is ambiguous, ask which bucket it means rather than guessing.

**If the config file doesn't exist yet**: ask the user for `repo` (default
to the current repo), whether there's a project board (and if so its
owner/number — `gh project list --owner <owner>` to find it), the label
lists (`gh label list --repo <repo>` to see what's available), and the
priority rule they want. Write the answers to
`.claude/github-triage.config.json` so future runs (in this repo, by this
skill or `issue-triage`) don't need to ask again.

If `project` is set, look up its `Status` and `Priority` (or equivalently
named) single-select fields' current field/option ids each run with `gh
project field-list <number> --owner <owner> --format json` — don't
hardcode ids in the config file, since they aren't worth tracking there and
can drift.

## Steps — create or refine an issue

1. If no tracking issue exists yet for the work: `gh issue create --repo <repo> --title <title> --body <body>`.
2. Write/update the body with a one-line summary up top, original text preserved below a divider:
   ```
   gh issue edit <num> --repo <repo> --body "$(printf '**Summary:** %s\n\n---\n\n%s' "$SUMMARY" "$ORIGINAL_BODY")"
   ```
3. Apply the type label, scope label, and the marker label in one call:
   `gh issue edit <num> --repo <repo> --add-label "bug,area-a,triaged"`.
4. If a project board is configured and the issue isn't on it yet, add it and capture the item id:
   `gh project item-add <number> --owner <owner> --url <issue-url> --format json --jq .id`
5. If a project board is configured, set its priority and status fields using the field/option ids looked up in Config. A reasonable default status mapping on creation: highest-severity priorities → a "ready to pick up" status, lowest priority (new feature) → a backlog-style status — adapt to whatever this repo's own status options actually are.
   ```
   gh project item-edit --project-id <PVT_id> --id <item-id> --field-id <field-id> --single-select-option-id <opt-id>
   ```

6. **Sanity-check the issue is actually refined, not just labeled.** Before
   considering an issue ready to work (and again before moving it to "in
   progress" below), read it critically:
   - **Is the body empty?** An issue with a title and nothing else is never
     self-explanatory — a title states a topic, not a scope, and the
     readings it permits usually differ enough to produce materially
     different work. Stop and ask the user what they want before planning,
     exploring further, or editing anything, then write their answer into
     the body so the next session doesn't have to ask again. This is not a
     judgement call and applies however obvious the title looks.
   - Is there anything else ambiguous or missing that would make you guess
     instead of ask? If so, ask the user rather than proceeding.
   - Does the issue's description reflect the **full blast radius** of the
     change, not just the most visible part? Check the actual codebase for
     other consumers of whatever is being changed — other interfaces that
     wrap or expose the same functionality (APIs, generated/served
     interfaces, admin or read-only tooling built on top of it, UI/consumers
     of it) — and if the issue is silent on one of them, add it to the body
     (or ask the user what the intended behavior there should be, e.g. what
     a UI change should look like) before treating the issue as ready.

   This isn't a one-time gate — re-run it whenever the issue's scope
   changes materially (a new `## Plan` section, a reopened issue, etc).
   Whatever it turns up feeds the scope confirmation below, which is what
   actually puts it in front of the user.

## Steps — record a plan

Once a plan-mode plan exists for the issue's work, insert or replace a
`## Plan` section in the issue body — placed after the Summary line, before
the original-body divider. If a `## Plan` section already exists from a
prior session, replace it rather than appending a duplicate:
```
gh issue edit <num> --repo <repo> --body "$(printf '**Summary:** %s\n\n## Plan\n\n%s\n\n---\n\n%s' "$SUMMARY" "$PLAN" "$ORIGINAL_BODY")"
```

## Steps — confirm the scope before work starts

Before the first code edit, post the intended scope back to the user and
**wait for a go-ahead**. This is a required round-trip, not a judgement
call — do it even when the issue looks unambiguous to you, and even when
the user's request sounded specific. "It seemed clear" is exactly the
state that produces a correction later.

State, briefly (a few lines, not a document):

- what will change, and what will **not** — the boundary is the part
  people actually correct
- the approach, whenever more than one reasonable one exists
- the blast radius surfaced by the check above, including any consumer
  you intend to leave alone
- anything you are assuming rather than know

Do not begin editing until the user replies. If they correct the scope,
update the issue body (and its `## Plan`, if present) to match **before**
starting, so the issue stays the record of what was actually agreed.

The only case that skips this: the user's own message already spelled the
scope out at this level of detail, leaving nothing to confirm.

## Steps — move to in progress

When development actually starts (first code edit or commit on the branch,
not just issue creation), re-run the refined-enough/blast-radius check
above, and confirm the scope with the user as described above, before
treating the issue as good to go. If a project board is
configured, set its status field to an "in progress" equivalent via the
same `gh project item-edit` pattern as above.

## Notes

- If the project board, its number, or its field names ever change,
  re-derive them from `gh project list --owner <owner>` / `gh project
  field-list <n> --owner <owner>` rather than trusting anything cached from
  a previous run — don't cache field/option ids in the config file itself.
- This skill doesn't know anything about a specific issue-tracker integration
  beyond GitHub's own Issues/Projects — if a repo also wants to resolve
  entries in an external error tracker (Sentry, etc.) once a fix ships, that
  belongs in a repo-specific wrapper skill, not here.
